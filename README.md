## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This package contains the ROS2 description (URDF/xacro files) of IC2D (Impedance Control in 2 Dimensions). The files were generated using a simplified version of the CAD model available on this [other repo](https://github.com/leggedrobotics-usp/ic2d) and the [solidworks_urdf_exporter](https://github.com/ros/solidworks_urdf_exporter).

The package also has 2 launch files:

- **rsp.launch.py**: robot state publisher. Simply loads the URDF onto the ``/robot_description`` topic. Can be visualized in Rviz2 or Foxglove.

- **gz_sim.launch.py**: launches the robot in a simulated environment (Ignition Gazebo). Currently loads a simple joint position controller (from [ros2_controllers](https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers)) for preliminary testing purposes.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
This repo is a standard ROS2 package (ament_cmake).

### 🛠 Prerequisites

- A ROS2 workspace (colcon)
    - See [this tutorial](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html) to learn how to create your own workspace.
    ```

### 💻 Installing

As mentioned above, this repo is a standard ROS2 package. Thus, you simply have to clone it inside your workspace's **src** directory.

```bash
cd <path_to_your_ros2_ws>/src
git clone https://github.com/leggedrobotics-usp/ic2d_description.git
```

Then, use **colcon** to build.

```bash
cd <path_to_your_ros2_ws>
colcon build --symlink-install
```

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Use the provided launch files to test basic robot visualization and Gazebo simulation. Use the launch and URDF files layout as a starting point to load different controllers and use cases.
